cloud Computing :  

cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

--------------------------------------------------------

Networking :

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. 
These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

-------------------------------------------

cloud providers :

The big three—Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS)—are considered the established leaders.
However, there are a host of other smaller or niche players that offer cloud services as well, including IBM, Alibaba, Oracle, Red Hat, DigitalOcean, and Rackspace.

-------------------------------------------------

SaaS (Software as a Service) :

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet.
Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365). 
SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.

Examples : Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting

----------------------------------------------------


IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) :

IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a cloud service model that offers on-demand infrastructure resources, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization, to businesses and individuals via the cloud.

Examples : DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE)

--------------------------------------------------
PaaS (Platform as a Service) :

PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.

Examples : AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift

-------------------------------------------------------


Server :

A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.
In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.

-------------------------------------------


Middleware :

Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it.
Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

--------------------------------------------------------
Virtualization :

Virtualization is a process that allows a computer to share its hardware resources with multiple digitally separated environments. 
Each virtualized environment runs within its allocated resources, such as memory, processing power, and storage.

--------------------------------------------

CUI :

CUI stands for Character User Interface. 
CUI is a way to interact with computer programs by issuing them commands as one or more lines of text. 
In CUI based systems, the user enters a command which a computer program can understand and then computer program processes the result and return the response.

------------------------------------------------

GUI :

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
It is a friendly visual environment that allows the user to perform any action without having to have programming knowledge.
An example of the GUI are the Windows, MacOs or Android environments, thanks to which commands can be sent through gestures or mouse movements, without the need to enter any code.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Hypervisor :

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). 
A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

-------------------------------------------

Cluster :

Cluster computing aggregates and coordinates a collection of virtual machines (VMs) to work together to perform a task.
Clusters typically have a single head node (sometimes called a controller node), a number of compute nodes, and possibly some specialty nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------

CI/CD :

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development.
The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
